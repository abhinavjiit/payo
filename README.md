1.i have made a broadcast listener(SmsListener) for listening the sms and then I have filtered the all transcational sms using pattern then we will have the msg and date and phone number and the status like credited or debited .according to that we will have the expenses and income.can do with the data whatever we want can send to backend.
2.
First activity is transactional chart .where I just show a piechart but I have taken hardcoded data .I haven't made any database for the transactions.
3.in the bottom there is a button for opening the monthly and daily expenses and income charts.
4.
In next activity after clicking on bottom button there are two buttons in next screen where you can see two button monthly or daily .those will show the data of accordingly after clicking by default it is monthly.
And to see all the transactions of the respective chart just click on chart it will show next screen where u can see the transactions of that month and day .that is also a hardcoded data.
5.to change the tag just click on the layout it will be changed automatically right now ,but we can use a dialog for the same and get the name in the list using callbacks.this is just for a demo purpose.
